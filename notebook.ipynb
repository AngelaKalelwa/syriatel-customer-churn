    "### Project Overview\n",
    "The objective of this project is to build a classifier that predicts whether a customer will \"soon\" stop doing business with SyriaTel, a telecommunications company.\n",
    "This is a binary classification problem, where the model will predict customer churn based on various features. By analyzing historical customer data, we aim to uncover patterns and factors that are indicative of customer churn. This will enable SyriaTel to take proactive measures to retain customers and reduce potential revenue loss.\n",
    "Churn prediction is crucial for the company to implement retention strategies and improve customer satisfaction.\n"

    "\n",
    "**Importance**: Understanding customer churn is critical for SyriaTel to minimize revenue loss and enhance customer loyalty. By identifying the patterns and factors that lead to churn, SyriaTel can implement targeted retention strategies, improve overall customer satisfaction, and reduce the financial impact of losing customers. The core question to address is: Are there predictable patterns in the customer data that can help in identifying customers at risk of churning, and how can these insights be used to retain them?"
